<p align="center">Welcome to Sado's Cabwalk 2 github page. Here you will always find the latest public updates for Cabwalk 2.

Cabwalk is an e2 that, similar to gravity hull, lets you walk around on a moving surface at any angle. It's made in three steps:

1. Editor: You create a series of areas/polygons and link them together using portals.
2. Map: You load the created map into a passive e2 that hosts the different maps for use in the simulator.
3. Simulator: You link a simulator to a native map and walk around on the created map.

As per playercore disappearing, I've released a "Lite" version of the Cabwalk 2 Simulator, which is also more compatible with non-trainbuild uses.

I have not yet made any tutorials. If you need any help, contact @sadogus on Discord and I'll help you out!

You can use temporary props to position your areas.
