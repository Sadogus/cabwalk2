<p align="center">Welcome to Sado's Cabwalk 2 github page. Here you will always find the latest public updates for Cabwalk 2.

As per playercore disappearing, I've released a "Lite" version of the Cabwalk 2 Simulator, which is also more compatible with non-trainbuild uses.

I have not yet made any tutorials. If you need any help, contact @sadogus on Discord and I'll help you out!
