<p align="center">Welcome to Sado's Cabwalk 2 github page. Here you will always find the latest public updates for Cabwalk 2.

Cabwalk is an e2 that, similar to gravity hull, lets you walk around on a moving surface at any angle. It's made in three steps:

1. Editor: You create a series of areas/polygons and link them together using portals.
2. Map: You load the created map into a passive e2 that hosts the different maps for use in the simulator.
3. Simulator: You link a simulator to a native map and walk around on the created map.

As per playercore disappearing, I've released a "Lite" version of the Cabwalk 2 Simulator, which is also more compatible with non-trainbuild uses.

I have not yet made any tutorials. If you need any help, contact @sadogus on Discord and I'll help you out!

Zones need to be linked together using portals

You can link separate map e2s together using global portals. This works across dupes.

You can use temporary props to position your areas.
